created with the intent of comparing millipyde to similar tools

The outputs of non-millipyde tools are as close as possible to the outputs of millipyde, however equality between the outputs was not always possible for the reasons listed below

1. the behavior of millipydes gaussian blur function for inputs with 4 channels (rgba)  fe
